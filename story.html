        Once upon a time, the students of Grade 8 at Maplewood School were excited as they prepared for their class picnic. Their class teacher, Mr. Johnson, decided to make the day memorable by incorporating maths challenges into their activities and teaching them about analysing HCF and LCM.

        As the picnic day came to an end, the students of Grade 8 at Maplewood School gathered, proud of their accomplishments. They had not only enjoyed their day but also learned valuable lessons about HCF and LCM, understanding how these concepts help in solving real-world problems. Mr. Johnson smiled, knowing the students would carry these mathematical insights with them, making their picnic an educational adventure they would never forget.
